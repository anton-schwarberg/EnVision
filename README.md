# EnVision
## Project Description
This university project simulated a real-world business case in the area of energy consultation. We began by identifying a problem, substantiating it with relevant literature, and ultimately solving it using data science methods. This project was done in April and Mai 2024.

## 1. Problem
### 1.1 Background
Buildings in the EU account for 36% of greenhouse gas emissions and 40% of energy consumption. In Germany, residential housing alone contributes to 15% of total national emissions (Statista, 2024). To meet its climate targets, such as 65% GHG reduction by 2030 and net, zero by 2045—the government promotes energy-efficient refurbishments, supported by mandatory energy consultations.

The role of energy consultants is therefore critical in guiding homeowners through sustainable renovations. Demand for such services is rising, with over 280,000 energy consultations in 2022 and a 25% annual increase in certified consultants.

### 1.2 Problem Spotlight
Despite growing demand, energy consultants face persistent challenges in acquiring and retaining clients. Two key barriers are ineffective Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and limited marketing and managerial skills. The absence of these capabilities can significantly hinder business success and, in competitive markets, even lead to failure (Radipere & Scheers, 2014). Additionally, customer acquisition is notably time-consuming: based on our interviews, consultants spend an average of 3 out of 13 total hours per consultation,nearly one quarter of their time, solely on acquiring clients.
## 2. Solution & Future Goals
Our goal is to support energy consultants in improving their sales and marketing strategies by leveraging machine learning. Specifically, we aim to help them acquire more clients by identifying the characteristics that make homeowners most likely to book an energy consultation. Based on these insights, we propose the development of a tailored marketing campaign aligned with the preferences of different customer segments, as well as a targeted sales strategy focused on homeowners with a high predicted interest in energy consultations.
## 3. Methodology
### 3.1 Data Collection
To better understand which homeowners are most likely to participate in energy consultations, we designed a structured survey targeting a diverse group of individuals across Germany between 2020 and 2024. The survey was distributed via networks of building cooperatives and homeowners’ associations, enabling direct access to a broad and demographically varied audience. This approach helped ensure high response rates and accurate insights into residential preferences, behaviors, and motivations.
The survey captured quantitative data using three types of input variables:

**Numeric continuous** (e.g., age, income)

**Numeric discrete** (e.g., energy awareness on a 1–5 scale)

**Categorical** (e.g., house type, occupation status)

The goal was to generate a rich dataset that reflects the diversity of German homeowners in both urban and rural contexts, allowing us to uncover meaningful patterns for customer targeting.
### 3.2 Research Focus
Based on a thorough literature review, we explored which factors most strongly influence a homeowner’s decision to book an energy consultation. The research built upon foundational work by scholars such as Galvin (2014), Janda (2011), Stern (2000), and Heinzle (2012), who investigated the roles of structural housing characteristics, energy usage behavior, and environmental attitudes contributing to sustainable choices.
