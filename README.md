# EnVision
## Project Description
This university project simulated a real-world business case in the area of energy consultation. We began by identifying a problem, substantiating it with relevant literature, and ultimately solving it using data science methods. This project was done in April and Mai 2024.

## 1. Problem
### 1.1 Background
Buildings in the EU account for 36% of greenhouse gas emissions and 40% of energy consumption. In Germany, residential housing alone contributes to 15% of total national emissions (Statista, 2024). To meet its climate targets, such as 65% GHG reduction by 2030 and net, zero by 2045â€”the government promotes energy-efficient refurbishments, supported by mandatory energy consultations.

The role of energy consultants is therefore critical in guiding homeowners through sustainable renovations. Demand for such services is rising, with over 280,000 energy consultations in 2022 and a 25% annual increase in certified consultants.

### 1.2 Problem Spotlight
Despite growing demand, energy consultants face persistent challenges in acquiring and retaining clients. Two key barriers are ineffective Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and limited marketing and managerial skills. The absence of these capabilities can significantly hinder business success and, in competitive markets, even lead to failure (Radipere & Scheers, 2014). Additionally, customer acquisition is notably time-consuming: based on our interviews, consultants spend an average of 3 out of 13 total hours per consultation,nearly one quarter of their time, solely on acquiring clients.
